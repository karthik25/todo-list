todo-list
=======================

This is just a pet project of mine in Ruby. That's because this is my
first large-scale project in Ruby! This project can be used to maintain a 
console based todo list for you.

Assuming your current directory is "src", you can run this by issuing the following:

> ruby main.rb

this is more or less like the shell where in you can enter commands like the following

list                 list all | [category_name]
add                  add "task_name" ["category_name"]
mark                 mark task_id
unmark               unmark task_id
delete               delete task_id

[..] implies that this parameter is optional. task_id is an integer that is listed
when you issue the "list" command. Thus, this is like an interpreter ran by an interpreter :)
